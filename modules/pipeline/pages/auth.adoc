= Authentication practices with Tekton

:docinfodir: ../common

The __upstream__ official documentation around authentication is available https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/auth/[here]. It mainly focus on authenticating through annotated secrets and service accounts. This document will try to explore the different way to use "secrets" for authentication in your ``Pipeline`` and ``Task``.

There is at least three ways to use secrets to authenticate to Github or Docker or.

- Using secrets and workspaces **highly recommended**
- Using a `ServiceAccount` **recommended**
- Using `VolumeMount` **not recommended**

[#secrets-and-workspaces]
== Using `Secret`(s) and `Workspace`(s)

This is the most flexible approach, especially if you use the __optional__ workspace feature.
The general idea behind this approach is:
- We use a workspace to bind a secret
- In the `Task` definition, we tell the command line (through a flag or an environment variable) where to find the secret content (aka the authentication content).

We'll take the example with a very simple `git-clone` Task, as well as a very simple `docker build`, but it can apply to anything else.

[#git-clone]
=== A `git clone` example

For this example, we assume we are using `git` with `ssh` to authenticate. Later in the document, we will show different approaches.

        Workspace is strongly recommended over other volume types

----

2. In the `script`, we are copying the content of the secret (as a folder) to `${HOME}/.ssh` which is the standard folder where `ssh` (and thus `git`) will look for credentials.

[source,bash]

$ tkn task start git-clone \
      --param url=git@github.com:vdemeester/buildkit-tekton \
      --workspace name=output,emptyDir="" \

Note that the warning `URL(\"git@github.com:vdemeester/buildkit-tekton\") appears to need SSH authentication but no SSH credentials have been provided` appears because the entrypoint didn't see any credentials coming from the annotated secrets attached to a `ServiceAccount` (see <<Using `ServiceAccount`(s)>>). It can safely be ignored in that case.

[#docker-configuration]
=== A docker configuration

For this example, we will be using an existing docker configuration file to be used inside a `Task`, similar to the <<git-clone>> example.
The `Task` definition is slightly similar to the <<git-clone>> one. Here we will use `skopeo` to copy an image to our own repository — it could be applied to other tools (`podman`, `buildah`, `docker`, …), basically any tool that is capable of reading a docker client configuration file.

[source,yaml]

----

1. Similar to <<git-clone>>, we define a workspace that should contain a `config.json` file. For a secret, this means a key named `config.json`.

2. Here we are just setting the `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the `dockerconfig` workspace path. `skopeo` (as a lot of docker-ish client) do read this environment variable to get the docker client configuration information, and in our case, the authentication informations.

=== With optional workspaces

This approach is extremely similar to the one above **but** using the optional feature of https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/workspaces/#using-workspaces-in-tasks[workspaces]. In a gist, this means a `Workspace` __might__ be bound to it (a.k.a. mounted as a volume in the `Pod`/`Container`) ; but it could also not be present.

The only difference here will be, to make sure our `Task` takes this __optional__ property into account. The https://hub.tekton.dev/tekton/task/git-clone[`git-clone`] upstream `Task` shows an example of that. Let's adapt the <<git-clone>> example with optional `Workspace` support.


[source,yaml]

      description: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task.
    - name: url
      description: The precise URL that was fetched by this Task.
  steps:
    - name: clone
      image: "$(params.gitInitImage)"
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env sh
        set -eu
        # This is necessary for recent version of git
        git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
        # (2)
        if [ "$(workspaces.ssh-directory.bound)" = "true" ] ; then
          cp -R "$(workspaces.ssh-directory.path)" "${HOME}"/.ssh
          chmod 700 "${HOME}"/.ssh
          chmod -R 400 "${HOME}"/.ssh/*
        fi
        CHECKOUT_DIR="$(workspaces.output.path)/"
        /ko-app/git-init \
          -url="$(params.url)" \
          -revision="$(params.revision)" \
          -path="${CHECKOUT_DIR}"
        cd "${CHECKOUT_DIR}"
        RESULT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
        EXIT_CODE="$?"
        if [ "${EXIT_CODE}" != 0 ] ; then
          exit "${EXIT_CODE}"
        fi
        printf "%s" "${RESULT_SHA}" > "$(results.commit.path)"
        printf "%s" "$(params.url)" > "$(results.url.path)"
----

1. Defines the workspace ; here the name is `ssh-directory`, and the description explain how should the secret be created. The example in <<git-clone>> apply here as well.

2. In the `script`, we are conditionally copying the content of the secret (as a folder) to `${HOME}/.ssh` which is the standard folder where `ssh` (and thus `git`) will look for credentials. If the `Workspace` is bound we copy, if it's not bound, we don't do anything.

The main advantage of using optionnal `Workspace` is that it makes your `Task` a bit more flexible. For example, with `git-clone`, if you are going to clone a publicly available git repository, you won't bind a `Secret` to the `Workspace`.

=== With `git-credentials`

We can apply both the approach with and without the __optional__ `Workspace` with other means of authenticating than `ssh` keys for `git-clone`, for example. Git has a notion of https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential/[`git-credential`] that could be used here. Using __optional__ workspace as above, it could look like the following.

[source,yaml]
----
        if [ "$(workspaces.basic_auth.bound)" = "true" ] ; then
          cp "$(workspaces.basic_auth.path)/.git-credentials" "${HOME}/.git-credentials"
          cp "$(workspaces.basic_auth.path)/.gitconfig" "${HOME}/.gitconfig"
          chmod 400 "${HOME}/.git-credentials"
          chmod 400 "${HOME}/.gitconfig"
        fi
----

[#serviceaccounts]
== Using `ServiceAccount`(s)

The `ServiceAccount` approach is the most widely documentated, especially https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/auth/[upstream]. The goal here is not to paraphrase the upstream documentation, so we'll just describe what the flow is.

This methods constits, in a gist, of the following:
- `Secret`(s) annotated specifcally, see <<annotations>>
- `ServiceAccount`(s) that are linked to those annotated `Secret`(s), see <<link-secret-to-serviceaccount>>
- `PipelineRun`(s) or `TaskRun`(s) using this/those `ServiceAccount`(s), see <<specify-serviceaccount-on-runs>>

[#annotations]
=== Annotations

Tetkon support two different type of authentication for secrets : `git` and `docker`. The annotation "reflect" this :

- `tekton.dev/git-{}` mark the annotated secret as a `git` secret.
- `tekton.dev/docker-{}` mark the annotated secret as a `docker` secret.

In addition, Tekton supports different types of secret per type of authentication. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types[Types of Secrets] kubernetes documentation for more details on those secrets.

- For `git` secrets:
  - `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` : basic authentication
  - `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` : ssh based authentication (keys, …)
- For `docker` secrets:
  - `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` : basic authentications
  - `kubernetes.io/dockercfg` : serialized `~/.dockercfg` file
  - `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` : serialized `~/.docker/config.json` file

We'll just show a set of example of annotated secrets with a quick description of them.

IMPORTANT: Almost all the example below are using `stringData`, which are direct content of the secret (visible for everybody that can get `Secret`). They can also all work with `data`, which is the `base64` encoded version of the data, that gives a little bit more obfuscation to the `Secrets`.

- [.underline]#basic authentication for `git`# : for gitlab.com as well as github.com. It seems not very secure to use the same user/password for authenticating different git provider, but that's just to show that a `Secret` can be used to target multiple host.

[#link-secret-to-serviceaccount]

[#volumemounts]
== Using `VolumeMount`(s)

Because this solution is **highly** discouraged, mainly due to the fact that `Volume` and `VolumeMount` might go away in the API, see https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2058[Remove "volumes" from Task before V1], we'll only scratch the surface on how it __would work__.

The idea of this solution is very similar to <<secrets-and-workspaces>> but using `Volume` and `VolumeMount` instead. You wount a `Secret` in a `Volume` using `VolumeMount` in the `Task`, and you act based on the path it is mounted on to copy the secrets to the right place.
